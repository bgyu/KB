The Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET (5+) works in multiple **phases** to manage memory efficiently and clean up unused objects. Below are the **major steps or phases** that the GC follows in its operation:

### 1. **Allocation Phase**
   - Memory is allocated for new objects on the **managed heap**.
   - Objects are placed in **Generation 0** (Gen 0), which is reserved for short-lived objects.
   - As new objects are created, the available space in the heap decreases. When the heap is full or certain thresholds are exceeded, a garbage collection is triggered.

### 2. **Mark Phase (Marking Reachable Objects)**
   - The GC starts by identifying **root objects**, which are **directly referenced by application code, static variables, or stack variables**.
   - From the root objects, the GC traces and marks all objects that are **reachable** (those directly or indirectly referenced by other objects).
   - Objects not marked as reachable are considered **garbage** and are candidates for collection.
   
### 3. **Relocate Phase (Compacting the Heap)**
   - In compacting garbage collectors, after marking, the GC may decide to **relocate live objects** to compact memory and eliminate fragmentation.
   - By moving objects closer together in memory, the GC frees up large contiguous memory blocks that can be reused for future allocations.
   - Objects that are **pinned** (e.g., used by unmanaged code) are left in place during this phase.

### 4. **Sweep Phase (Reclaiming Memory)**
   - After relocation, the GC reclaims the memory occupied by **dead objects** (those not marked as reachable).
   - The memory used by these objects is now available for new allocations.
   
### 5. **Promote Phase (Generation Promotion)**
   - Objects that survive a garbage collection in **Generation 0** are **promoted** to **Generation 1**, and if they survive further collections, they can be promoted to **Generation 2**.
   - Generation 2 is reserved for **long-lived objects** like caches, static data, or objects that persist throughout the application’s lifetime.
   - Promotion helps improve GC performance by focusing collections on short-lived objects (younger generations) more frequently than long-lived objects.

### 6. **Finalization (Optional)**
   - Some objects may have a **finalizer** (also known as a destructor), which needs to be called before the object is fully collected.
   - Finalizers provide a way to clean up unmanaged resources (e.g., file handles, database connections) before the memory is reclaimed.
   - The finalization queue holds objects waiting to be finalized, and finalization happens in a separate process before the memory is reclaimed.

### 7. **Concurrent and Background GC (for Large Applications)**
   - In **server GC** mode (used for high-performance scenarios like web servers), GC can run **concurrently** or in the background to avoid long pauses in application execution.
   - This allows for **concurrent marking** of objects while the application is running, minimizing the impact on performance.

### 8. **Ephemeral, Full, and Large Object Heap Collection**
   - The GC primarily focuses on **ephemeral collections**, which target Generation 0 and Generation 1, where most objects are short-lived.
   - Occasionally, a **full GC** is triggered, which also includes **Generation 2** collection for long-lived objects.
   - Objects larger than 85,000 bytes are allocated on the **Large Object Heap (LOH)**, and LOH has its own separate GC cycle due to the high cost of managing large objects.

### Summary of Major GC Phases:
1. **Allocation** – Objects are allocated in Generation 0.
2. **Marking** – Roots are identified, and reachable objects are marked.
3. **Relocation** – Live objects are moved to compact memory (optional).
4. **Sweeping** – Unreachable objects are reclaimed.
5. **Promotion** – Surviving objects are promoted to higher generations.
6. **Finalization** – Cleanup of unmanaged resources (if necessary).
7. **Concurrent/Background GC** – Reduces application pauses.
8. **Full and LOH Collection** – Occasional full GC includes Generation 2 and LOH.

These phases ensure that .NET efficiently manages memory while minimizing the impact on application performance.
