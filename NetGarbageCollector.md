The Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET (5+) works in multiple **phases** to manage memory efficiently and clean up unused objects. Below are the **major steps or phases** that the GC follows in its operation:

### 1. **Allocation Phase**
   - Memory is allocated for new objects on the **managed heap**.
   - Objects are placed in **Generation 0** (Gen 0), which is reserved for short-lived objects.
   - As new objects are created, the available space in the heap decreases. When the heap is full or certain thresholds are exceeded, a garbage collection is triggered.

### 2. **Mark Phase (Marking Reachable Objects)**
   - The GC starts by identifying **root objects**, which are **directly referenced by application code, static variables, or stack variables**.
   - From the root objects, the GC traces and marks all objects that are **reachable** (those directly or indirectly referenced by other objects).
   - Objects not marked as reachable are considered **garbage** and are candidates for collection.
   
### 3. **Relocate Phase (Compacting the Heap)**
   - In compacting garbage collectors, after marking, the GC may decide to **relocate live objects** to compact memory and eliminate fragmentation.
   - By moving objects closer together in memory, the GC frees up large contiguous memory blocks that can be reused for future allocations.
   - Objects that are **pinned** (e.g., used by unmanaged code) are left in place during this phase.

### 4. **Sweep Phase (Reclaiming Memory)**
   - After relocation, the GC reclaims the memory occupied by **dead objects** (those not marked as reachable).
   - The memory used by these objects is now available for new allocations.
   
### 5. **Promote Phase (Generation Promotion)**
   - Objects that survive a garbage collection in **Generation 0** are **promoted** to **Generation 1**, and if they survive further collections, they can be promoted to **Generation 2**.
   - Generation 2 is reserved for **long-lived objects** like caches, static data, or objects that persist throughout the application’s lifetime.
   - Promotion helps improve GC performance by focusing collections on short-lived objects (younger generations) more frequently than long-lived objects.

### 6. **Finalization (Optional)**
   - Some objects may have a **finalizer** (also known as a destructor), which needs to be called before the object is fully collected.
   - Finalizers provide a way to clean up unmanaged resources (e.g., file handles, database connections) before the memory is reclaimed.
   - The finalization queue holds objects waiting to be finalized, and finalization happens in a separate process before the memory is reclaimed.

### 7. **Concurrent and Background GC (for Large Applications)**
   - In **server GC** mode (used for high-performance scenarios like web servers), GC can run **concurrently** or in the background to avoid long pauses in application execution.
   - This allows for **concurrent marking** of objects while the application is running, minimizing the impact on performance.

### 8. **Ephemeral, Full, and Large Object Heap Collection**
   - The GC primarily focuses on **ephemeral collections**, which target Generation 0 and Generation 1, where most objects are short-lived.
   - Occasionally, a **full GC** is triggered, which also includes **Generation 2** collection for long-lived objects.
   - Objects larger than 85,000 bytes are allocated on the **Large Object Heap (LOH)**, and LOH has its own separate GC cycle due to the high cost of managing large objects.

### Summary of Major GC Phases:
1. **Allocation** – Objects are allocated in Generation 0.
2. **Marking** – Roots are identified, and reachable objects are marked.
3. **Relocation** – Live objects are moved to compact memory (optional).
4. **Sweeping** – Unreachable objects are reclaimed.
5. **Promotion** – Surviving objects are promoted to higher generations.
6. **Finalization** – Cleanup of unmanaged resources (if necessary).
7. **Concurrent/Background GC** – Reduces application pauses.
8. **Full and LOH Collection** – Occasional full GC includes Generation 2 and LOH.

These phases ensure that .NET efficiently manages memory while minimizing the impact on application performance.


In the .NET runtime, the Garbage Collector (GC) operates as a complex, low-level system. Its implementation involves several major function calls in the native runtime libraries, particularly in the **CoreCLR** (Core Common Language Runtime). The function call paths are part of the internal workings of the GC, and while developers don't interact with them directly, understanding these paths helps in diagnosing performance issues or customizing the GC.

Here’s an overview of the **major function call paths** involved in the GC implementation in .NET runtime (5+), based on the CoreCLR source code.

### 1. **GC Initialization**
   - The GC system is initialized when the runtime starts. This is done as part of the overall runtime initialization process.
   - Major function calls:
     - `EEStartupHelper()` – Initializes various components of the runtime, including the GC.
     - `GCHeap::Initialize()` – Initializes the GC heap.
     - `GCToOSInterface::Initialize()` – Sets up platform-specific details for the GC.
     - `GCHeap::CreateGCHeap()` – Creates the instance of the garbage collector used throughout the application.

### 2. **Object Allocation**
   - Memory allocation for objects in .NET is handled by the GC, specifically for managed objects on the heap.
   - Major function calls:
     - `Alloc()` – The core allocation function that allocates memory for an object.
     - `AllocLargeObject()` – Allocates large objects that are placed on the **Large Object Heap (LOH)**.
     - `AllocSmallObject()` – Allocates smaller objects that fit within Generation 0.
     - `GCHeap::Alloc()` – A higher-level allocation function that routes requests to the appropriate generation's allocator.

### 3. **Triggering a Garbage Collection**
   - Garbage collection is triggered when memory thresholds are exceeded, or when explicitly requested by the application using `GC.Collect()`.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::GarbageCollect()` – The main entry point for triggering a collection.
     - `GCHeap::GcCollect()` – Triggers a collection for a specific generation.
     - `GCHeap::GcCollectGeneration()` – Collects objects from the specified generation.
     - `GCToEEInterface::GcScanRoots()` – Scans the managed roots (e.g., stacks, statics, finalizable objects) to determine which objects are still reachable.

### 4. **Mark Phase (Tracing Reachable Objects)**
   - The Mark phase identifies objects that are reachable (i.e., still in use by the application) by traversing from the root set (globals, statics, stack objects).
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::MarkPhase()` – Marks reachable objects.
     - `CNameSpace::MarkRoots()` – Marks objects starting from the roots.
     - `GCHeap::MarkObject()` – Marks individual objects as reachable.
     - `Object::MarkObject()` – Recursively marks objects referenced by other objects.
     - `GCToEEInterface::Promote()` – Promotes references to higher generations for objects that survive collection.

### 5. **Plan Phase (Planning Object Relocation)**
   - After marking, the GC plans which objects to relocate (compact) to optimize memory usage.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::PlanPhase()` – Plans the relocation of objects.
     - `GCHeap::ComputeRelocation()` – Computes where objects will be moved in memory.
     - `GCHeap::Relocate()` – Relocates marked objects to reduce fragmentation.
     - `CFinalize::RelocateRoots()` – Updates the references for objects that are being relocated.

### 6. **Relocate Phase (Compacting the Heap)**
   - In compacting GCs, objects are moved to minimize fragmentation.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::RelocatePhase()` – Performs the actual relocation of objects in the heap.
     - `HeapSegment::Relocate()` – Handles object relocation within segments of the heap.
     - `Object::Relocate()` – Moves individual objects in memory, adjusting their pointers.

### 7. **Sweep Phase (Reclaiming Memory)**
   - In the Sweep phase, memory occupied by unreachable objects is reclaimed.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::SweepPhase()` – Reclaims memory used by unreachable objects.
     - `HeapSegment::Sweep()` – Frees memory for objects in a specific heap segment.
     - `LargeObjectHeap::Sweep()` – Special handling for large objects, reclaiming memory in the LOH.
     - `FinalizeObject()` – Invokes finalizers for objects that need finalization before being reclaimed.

### 8. **Finalization (Cleaning Up Resources)**
   - Finalizers are invoked for objects that implement finalization, allowing them to clean up unmanaged resources before collection.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::FinalizeObjects()` – Invokes finalizers for objects queued for finalization.
     - `CFinalize::ProcessFinalizers()` – Manages the finalizer thread and invokes destructors.
     - `Object::Finalize()` – Calls the finalizer of the object.

### 9. **Promotion (Generation Management)**
   - Objects that survive collection are promoted to higher generations to minimize the frequency of collection for long-lived objects.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::Promote()` – Promotes objects that survive a collection to a higher generation.
     - `GcGeneration::PromoteObject()` – Moves objects from Generation 0 to Generation 1, or from Generation 1 to Generation 2.

### 10. **Concurrent and Background GC**
   - In server and background modes, garbage collection can run concurrently with application execution to reduce pause times.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::StartBackgroundGC()` – Starts a background GC process.
     - `GCHeap::RunBackgroundGC()` – Executes the background garbage collection.
     - `GCHeap::ConcurrentMarkPhase()` – Marks reachable objects concurrently while the application is running.
     - `GCHeap::ConcurrentSweepPhase()` – Concurrently reclaims memory for unreachable objects.

### 11. **Ephemeral and Full GC**
   - **Ephemeral GC** focuses on short-lived objects in Generation 0 and Generation 1, while **Full GC** includes Generation 2 and the LOH.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::CollectEphemeral()` – Collects objects in Generation 0 and Generation 1.
     - `GCHeap::CollectFull()` – Collects objects across all generations, including Generation 2 and LOH.
     - `GCHeap::CollectLargeObjectHeap()` – Collects objects in the Large Object Heap (LOH).

### 12. **Final Phases (Updating References)**
   - After collection, all references are updated to point to the new locations of objects that were relocated during the GC.
   - Major function calls:
     - `GCHeap::UpdatePointers()` – Updates references to relocated objects.
     - `Object::UpdateReferences()` – Adjusts pointers for individual objects that were moved.
     - `CNameSpace::UpdateRootPointers()` – Updates pointers from root objects to relocated objects.
